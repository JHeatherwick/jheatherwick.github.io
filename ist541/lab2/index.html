			<strong>Step 1:</strong> Zoom In and Out of the Mural Canvas
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p> The first step is learning how to zoom in and out of the canvas. The zoom settings are located at the bottom right of your Mural canvas. You can click on <strong>Zoom Settings</strong> to see your options available.</p> 
			<br>
			
				<strong>Mouse:</strong> Move your cursor over the area on the canvas you wish to zoom in or out. Using the roller ball of your mouse, scroll up with your index finger to zoom out and scroll down with your index finger to zoom in.</p>   
						
			<br>
		
			
			       <p><strong>Trackpad:</strong> Move your cursor over the area on the canvas you wish to zoom in or out. For Google Chrome users, you can pinch your thumb and index finger to zoom in. Spread your thumb and index finger apart on the trackpack to zoom out. For Firefox users, hold down the Alt key while you slide your two fingers up and down on the trackpad.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  
			<p class = "warning"> <span class="material-icons">
feedback
</span> It important to remember to set your zoom settings to match how you move your cursor. If you use a computer mouse, select mouse. If you use a laptop with a trackpad, select trackpad. Click zoom settings again or the X in the top right&nbsp; to collapse the settings window.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

			<strong>Step 2:</strong> Move Around the Canvas or Edit the Canvas
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p><strong>Move the Canvas:</strong> Place your cursor on the hand icon and click on it. It is located in the upper left hand corner next to the canvas mini-map. Your cursor will turn into a hand. You can now move the canvas around to view a different location. A Mural canvas fills up quickly with images and sticky notes. You will want to easily move about the canvas to explore it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>   
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
					
       <p><strong>Edit the Canvas:</strong> Place your cursor on the hand icon and click on it again. Your cursor will turn into a pointer. The editing features will appear on the left side of the mural canvas. You can now use the editing features.</p>
			
			<p class = "warning"> <span class="material-icons">
feedback
</span> &nbsp;You can easily toggle from the <strong>Edit Mode</strong> to the <strong>Move Mode</strong> by pressing down on the space bar as you move your mouse. Release the space bar to continue editing your canvas. When you are in edit mode you will see a collumn of tools appear on the far left side of the canvas. You can begin adding content to the canvas.</p>

			<strong>Step 3:</strong> Add a Sticky Note
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p><strong>Click on the Sticky Note Icon:</strong> &nbsp;In the edit mode, a tool bar will appear on the far left side of the canvas. Place your cursor on the sticky note icon and click on it. A window will expand and provide elements for you to add to the canvas. You can add text, 3x3 sticky notes, 5x3 sticky notes, or circle sticky notes to the canvas.</p>   
						<br>
       <p><strong>Select a Sticky Note:</strong> Place your cursor on the blue sticky note and click on it. Keep your cursor clicked down on the sticky note and then drag it over to the canvas. You may wish to drag over multiple sticky notes of any color.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class = "warning"> <span class="material-icons">
feedback
</span> If you don't see the tools on the left side of the canvas it means you are not in edit mode. Revisit <strong>Step 2</strong> and review how to return to edit mode. I&nbsp;recommend using the default sticky note size. If the text on a sticky note is too small to read, zoom in. If itâ€™s too large, zoom out.</p>

			<strong>Step 4:</strong> Type Inside the Sticky Note
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p><strong>Type into the Sticky Note:</strong> Place your cursor on the sticky note and click. You can begin typing into the sticky note. You can click outside the sticky note when you are done entering in your text. Place your cursor on the sticky note again to move it anywhere on the canvas.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The sticky note text can be updated at any time by double clicking inside the sticky note. You will notice additional features appear in a bar outside the sticky note. You may wish to explore the additional features available to change the font, color of the sticky note, and you may want to draw on the sticky note for fun.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class = "warning"> <span class="material-icons">
  feedback
</span> If your sticky note appears very small then you need to zoom into your canvas. As a reminder, hover over the sticky note and zoom in. Revisit <strong>Step 1</strong> for zoom in and zoom out instructions.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

			<p><strong>Click on the Question Mark Icon:</strong> Place your cursor on the question mark icon located in the upper right hand side of the Mural canvas and click on it. The drop down menu will display a variety of resources available to you to learn more about Mural. I recommend visiting the shortcuts  to discover new ways to interact with the canvas.</p>

</span> As you gain confidence with zooming in and out, moving around the canvas, editing the canvas, and adding sticky notes then begin exploring the additional features.
