                <h3>Organizations are listening to lessons learned from the pandemic. They realize they can change their operating model to remote first work. The rise in remote positions means leaders must learn new ways for teams to collaborate. Using facilitation skills and online virtual collaboration tools helps leaders create meetings that engage their employees and get the work done in a meaningful and interactive way. </h3>
